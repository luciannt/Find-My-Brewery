Brew Pub is a one page app that uses a public API to search for breweries in a designated area. The page is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

To check out the API documentation: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation

The main functionality is built using a fetch request. The user has the ability to search by city and state, as well as type of brewery. The API returns up to 10 breweries with their name, address, and website.
